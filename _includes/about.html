                    from the ActionScript 3.0 codebase. See the motivation behind it.</p>

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>There is plenty of frameworks and patterns out there that helps you to write DOM-based applications. There
                    is no scalable solution yet to architecture a canvas-based application though. </p>
                <p>Robotlegs has proven itself of being a mature solution from the ActionScript community for interactive experiences.</p>
